## Custom formats

### Time

`floor(x/6)`:`(x%6)*10`

Ex.:

- 0x25 (37) -> 06:10
- 0x84 (132) -> 22:00

### Day binary

Value must be interpreted as binary string. For each day a bit exist.
Least significant bit is monday and highest significant bit is sunday.

Ex.:

- 0x0 (0) -> 0000000 -> All days deactivated
- 0x7 (7) -> 0000111 -> Mo,Tue, Wed activated
- 0x40 (64) -> 1000000 -> Sunday activated
- 0x7F (127) -> 1111111 -> All days activated

### Flag&Level

Value is composed of by 5 binary encoded flags and the oven level.
The 5 high significant bits, specifies the following flags in order:
- unknown
- unknown
- unknown
- night/day temperature feature enabled
- unknown

The three least significant bits specified the level.
To get the night/day temperature flag to the following:

```c++
return x & 0x10;
```

To find out the current level use the following snippet:

```c++
return x & 0x07;
```

Ex.:

- `0xDD (221)` -> Night/Day disabled, Level 5
- `0xC9 (201)` -> Night/Day enabled, Level 1
